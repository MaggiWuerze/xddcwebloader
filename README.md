# Running The App
### Locally 
The simplest way to run it is to simply execute the jar from the [releases](https://github.com/MaggiWuerze/xddcwebloader/releases) section. it packs everything except a java runtime, so as long as you have java you can run it and start right away.
### Docker
The next best option is to use the Dockerfiles found in the repository to build and run the app through your docker installation.
### From The IDE
This option is mainly meant for people looking into the code or trying to make a PR/Fork for it. Open the project in your favourite Java IDE and execute the XdccloaderApplication class.  

I'd recommend IntelliJ. For this approach also see the building section.

# Building
Building the app (and running it from your IDE) requires you to install the following requirements:  
- Node.js (17+)  
- JDK (17+)
